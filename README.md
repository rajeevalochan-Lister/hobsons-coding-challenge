# Coding Challenge

Package contains solutions for the two challenges described below:

# Challenge 1

Write and test a function to sort a list of numbers so that odd numbers are sorted before even numbers, and relative order is preserved, viz. [1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 16] is sorted as [1, 3, 7, 2, 4, 16].

# Challenge #2

Write and test a function to return all unique permutations of a list of numbers, so given [1, 2, 3, 3], returns [1, 2, 3, 3], [2, 1, 3, 3], etc. with no repeating permutations.

Sample unit test cases were defined in Jest and is available to validate the solution for the above challenges.

# Test code

Run **npm install**
Run **npm run test-dev**
